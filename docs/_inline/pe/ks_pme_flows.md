Use the Kaplan-Schoar method to re-scale the private equity flows to match the
public market equivalents (PME) for comparison. This method works as follows,
for each period, re-scale the amount as: amount * (pme_price_final_period /
pme_price_current_period). Basically you are future valuing the amount to the
final period based on the returns of the PME.
