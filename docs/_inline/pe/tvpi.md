Total Value to Paid-In Capital is a measure of the performance of a private
equity fund. It represents the total value of a fund relative to the amount of
capital paid into the fund to date. The total value of a fund is the sum of
realised value (all distributions made to investors to date) plus the
unrealised value (residual value of investments) still held by the fund.
